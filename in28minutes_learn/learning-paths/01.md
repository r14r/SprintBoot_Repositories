## What Our 350,000 Learners Say

- ★★★★★ I've taken many courses on Udemy and this is **by far the best course I've ever taken** period. The instructor is very knowledgeable and takes the time to go into each topic in great detail!  While some instructors just browse through topics leaving you confused, this instructor **explains everything**! He even shows you detailed logs that shows you exactly what the application is doing! I would **highly recommend** this course! I am hoping that this instructor releases more courses in the future!
- ★★★★★ The teaching on this course is **heads above the others**.  I switched from one of the other Spring course to this one and I'm very glad I did.  Each concept is explained very clearly so that **you understand WHY Spring came about and what it's doing** rather than just blindly following a demo of 'put this here, put that there' like on some other courses.  I'm understanding each and every line properly now - difficult concepts are hammered home repeatedly with clear examples and explanations.  There are many knowledgeable Spring developers out there, but not so many that are such good teachers.  Ranga also includes old ways of doing things e.g. xml based configuration - that's very important as you're highly likely to have to work on such applications in the real world.
- ★★★★★ Its an **excellent course** which gives all positive and negative flow, and gives you lots of info around basics what is happening  behind the screen. I took it as a refresher course and very delighted to gain without going through a 600 page book which is diff for working person. All the examples work and gives your mind a good grasp on concepts when you see actual code working.
- ★★★★★ This is a **brilliant course** that you have created. You have summarised basics in such a way that now I understand what Spring truly is. If we go through documentation of Spring, they tend to confuse the whole topic by putting log of technical jargons, without explaining. This makes it harder to follow Spring documentation. Thanks again, you experience and maturity is being reflected in this course.
