## What Our 350,000 Learners Say

- ★★★★★ This is the perfect course.  The instructor takes you **step by step** ensuring you learn anything and everything pertaining to deploying your Spring Boot applications to **Elastic Beanstalk**.  Spring Boot App 1 is simple. Spring Boot App 5 is complex.  The way the instructor takes you thru each app, is amazing.
- ★★★★★ Exactly what I've been looking for! soo many **AWS** courses read like an encyclopedia or text book. few offer any sort of **practical application**. this course was great because it starts simple and builds to complex, by way of actual examples. awesome course.
- ★★★★★ This is an excellent into to AWS ElasticBeanstalk.  But even more important, is that the instructor explains many elements of the Spring MVC, differences in deployment of a jar/war file, H2 in-memory db, and so many other gems.  Ranga has so kindly and methodically filled-in so many of my gaps in knowledge with regards to web development.  The value of this course goes waaaay beyond the actual price of the course.  I am a true believe in the 'in28minutes' catalog and will continue purchasing further courses from in28minutes.
- ★★★★★ Another great course from in28minutes, plenty of hands-on and a very good overview of deploying Spring Boot Java apps to **Microsoft Azure**, I especially liked the container and scaling sections. The pace is perfect and the instructor is very clear and describes everything in detail that he is teaching.
- ★★★★★ A **brilliant course** that really focuses on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, covering multiple deployments including connecting to a separate database, also liked the section on AWS Codepipeline, the pace is good and the instructor is clear and very knowledgeable, I highly recommend this course.
